# Android App for CampusAffordHub

This folder contains the native Android application generated by Capacitor.

## Important Notes

⚠️ **Do not edit files in this folder directly unless you know what you're doing.**

This Android project is automatically generated and managed by Capacitor. Your main web app code is in the root of the project.

## Opening in Android Studio

To work on the Android app, run from the project root:

```bash
npx cap open android
```

This requires:
- Android Studio installed
- Android SDK configured
- Google Play Developer account (for deployment)

## Building

Always build the web app first, then sync:

```bash
npm run build
npx cap sync
npx cap open android
```

Then build in Android Studio using the build tools.

See [MOBILE_DEPLOYMENT.md](../MOBILE_DEPLOYMENT.md) in the project root for complete deployment instructions.
