# iOS App for CampusStore

This folder contains the native iOS application generated by Capacitor.

## Important Notes

⚠️ **Do not edit files in this folder directly unless you know what you're doing.**

This iOS project is automatically generated and managed by Capacitor. Your main web app code is in the root of the project.

## Opening in Xcode

To work on the iOS app, run from the project root:

```bash
npx cap open ios
```

This requires:
- macOS computer
- Xcode installed
- Apple Developer account (for deployment)

## Building

Always build the web app first, then sync:

```bash
npm run build
npx cap sync
npx cap open ios
```

Then build in Xcode by pressing the Play button (▶️).

## More Information

See [MOBILE_DEPLOYMENT.md](../MOBILE_DEPLOYMENT.md) in the project root for complete deployment instructions.
